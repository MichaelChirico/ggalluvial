abstract = {Veganism is an increasingly popular lifestyle within Western societies. However, there is no consistent definition of veganism across published research or used by vegan advocacy groups. This has implications for measurement and coherence of the research literature, and adds to public confusion of what veganism entails. This exploratory study used a community sample across three dietary groups (vegan = 309, omnivore = 216, vegetarian = 95) to assess ranked preferences for definitions of veganism used by vegan advocacy groups. Participants were also asked to explain their ranking order in an open-ended question. Across all three dietary groups, the United Kingdom (UK) Vegan Society definition was preferred. The majority of vegans selected the UK definition as their first preference, omnivores underwent five rounds of preference reallocation before the UK definition was selected, and vegetarians underwent four rounds before the UK definition was selected. A reflexive thematic analysis participants' explanation of their rankings identified four themes: (1) Diet vs. lifestyle, (2) Absolutism, (3) Social justice, and (4) Animal justice. There was community consensus regarding the definition of veganism, qualitatively the reasons for this preference best align conceptually with the UK definition. Future research should consider using the UK definition of veganism to increase coherence within the field, and that strict definitions of veganism may exclude people from the label.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 the authors. Healthy aging is accompanied by disruptions in the functional modular organization of the human brain. Cross-sectional studies have shown age-related reductions in the functional segregation and distinctiveness of brain networks. However, less is known about the longitudinal changes in brain functional modular organization and their associations with aging-related cognitive decline.Weexamined age- and aging-related changes in functional architecture of the cerebral cortex using a dataset comprising a cross-sectional healthy young cohort of 57 individuals (mean±SD age, 23.71±3.61 years, 22 males) and a longitudinal healthy elderly cohort of 72 individuals (mean±baseline age, 68.22±5.80 years, 39 males) with 2-3 time points (18 -24 months apart) of task-free fMRI data. We found both cross-sectional (elderly vs young) and longitudinal (in elderly) global decreases in network segregation (decreased local efficiency), integration (decreased global efficiency), and module distinctiveness (increased participation coefficient and decreased system segregation). At the modular level, whereas cross-sectional analyses revealed higher participation coefficient across all modules in the elderly compared with young participants, longitudinal analyses revealed focal longitudinal participation coefficient increases in three higherorder cognitive modules: control network, default mode network, and salience/ventral attention network. Cross-sectionally, elderly participants also showed worse attention performance with lower local efficiency and higher mean participation coefficient, and worse global cognitive performance with higher participation coefficient in the dorsal attention/control network. These findings suggest that healthy aging is associated with whole-brain connectome-wide changes in the functional modular organization of the brain, accompanied by loss of functional segregation, particularly in higher-order cognitive networks.},

abstract = {The Sankey diagram is an important aid in identifying inefficiencies and potential for savings when dealing with resources. It was developed over 100 years ago by the Irish engineer Riall Sankey to analyze the thermal efficiency of steam engines and has since been applied to depict the energy and material balances of complex systems. The Sankey diagram is the main tool for visualizing industrial metabolism and hence is widely used in industrial ecology. In the history of the early 20th century, it played a major role when raw materials were scarce and expensive and engineers were making great efforts to improve technical systems. Sankey diagrams can also be used to map value flows in systems at the operational level or along global value chains. The article charts the historical development of the diagrams. After the First World War the diagrams were used to produce thermal balances of production plants for glass and cement and to optimize the energy input. In the 1930s, steel and iron ore played a strategic role in Nazi Germany. Their efficient use was highlighted with Sankey diagrams. Since the 1990s, these diagrams have become common for displaying data in life cycle assessments (LCAs) of products. Sankey diagrams can also be used to map value flows in systems at the operational level or along global value added chains. This article, the first of a pair, charts the historical development. The companion article discusses the methodology and the implicit assumptions of such Sankey diagrams.},

The support for quantitative flow tracing across the flow graph as well as representations at different levels of detail facilitate the understanding of complex flow situations. The energy flow in a city serves as a sample scenario for our system. Different forms of energy are distributed within the city and they are transformed into heat, electricity, or other forms of energy. These processes are visualized and interactively explored. In addition our system can be used as a planning tool for the exploration of alternative scenarios by interactively manipulating different parameters in the energy flow network.},

As designers of charts we have to make sure that information is shown with a minimum of distortion. We have to also consider illusions and other perceptual limitations of our audience. In this paper we discuss the effect and strength of the line width illusion, a Muller-Lyer type illusion, on designs related to displaying associations between categorical variables. Parallel sets and hammock plots are both affected by line width illusions. We introduce the common-angle plot as an alternative method for displaying categorical data in a manner that minimizes the effect from perceptual illusions. Results from user studies both highlight the need for addressing line-width illusions in displays and provide evidence that common angle charts successfully resolve this issue. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

abstract = {Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) have been promoted as a management approach to address many of the economic and conservation challenges encountered in fisheries. ITQs are expected to improve fishery outcomes based on assumptions about who owns the quota, how ownership is transferred and how ownership incentivizes stewardship. Changes in the ownership profile of the British Columbia Pacific halibut fishery were examined over a 25-year period. This analysis revealed that, despite the halibut fishery traditionally being an owner-operator fishery, with owner-operators owning and catching 90{\%} of the halibut in 1991, owner-operators have been increasingly marginalized in the fishery, catching 45{\%} of the halibut in 2016 while owning 15{\%} of the quota. The original grantees of quota from 1991 continue to own over half of the quota, and original grantees comprised half of the owner-operators active in the fishery in 2016. However, these original grantees have been steadily becoming a new investor class, non-existent in 1991, alongside new investors who have bought into the fishery as a source of income from leasing. A new dynamic has emerged in the fishery, with the separation of quota ownership from fishing operations. This raises questions about the assumptions underpinning the rationale for ITQs as an efficient market-based mechanism for fishery management and as a means to improve stewardship incentives. Also questionable are the equity, the long-term viability, and the objectives this fishery is serving with this new ownership structure.},

abstract = {Recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) places a major burden on the healthcare system. Previous studies have suggested that specific C. difficile strains, or ribotypes, are associated with severe disease and/or recurrence. However, in some patients a new strain is detected in subsequent infections, complicating longitudinal studies focused on strain differences that may contribute to disease outcome. We examined ribotype composition over time in patients who did or did not develop recurrence to examine infection with multiple C. difficile ribotypes (mixed infection), during the course of infection. Using a retrospective patient cohort, we isolated and ribotyped a median of 36 C. difficile colonies from 61 patients (105 total samples) at initial infection, recurrence (a second case of CDI within 15–56 days of initial infection), and reinfection (a second case of CDI after 56 days of initial infection). We observed mixed infection in 78.6{\%} of samples at initial infection in patients who went on to develop recurrence compared to 18.1{\%} of patients who did not, and mixed infection remained associated with subsequent recurrence after adjusting for gender and prior antibiotic exposure (OR 3.5, 95{\%} CI 1.3–9.4, P =.015). In patients who were sampled longitudinally (44 consecutive events in 32 patients), the dominant ribotype changed in 31.8{\%} of consecutive samples and the newly dominant ribotype was not detected in prior samples from that patient. Our results suggest that mixed C. difficile infection is more prevalent than previously demonstrated and potentially a marker of susceptibility to recurrence.},

abstract = {Modeling and measuring both potential and actual urban greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigations can serve as a foundation for urban sustainability management. A growing number of studies have analyzed various aspects of GHG emissions from the use of private vehicles, emphasizing the significant share they represent of overall emissions, and also exploring measures to reduce these emissions. Commuting to and from work is a significant form of urban travel. Most existing analyses have focused on urban transportation-related emissions at the overall urban scale. Much less research has been published concerning fine-scale emissions analysis of urban commute patterns and specific commuting routes. This manuscript presents a detailed analysis of commute related GHG emissions from private vehicles used by the city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa (Israel) residents. The analysis found that 60{\%} of the overall urban private vehicles related emissions can be attributed to commuting, emitting {\~{}}215,000 t CO 2 e annually. We analyzed GHG emissions related to 257 inter-city and 64 commute routes within the city, ranging between 100 and 5600 t CO 2 e annually. Potential scenarios for GHG mitigation are also presented showing that relatively mild technological, behavioral and policy changes can potentially save 10–51{\%} of emissions related to commute within the city, amounting to 3000–17,000 t CO 2 e annually. Findings show that commute-route-specific carbon quantification can be used as a tool for socio-spatial tailored policies, advancing urban GHG mitigation.},

@article{Baudron2019,
abstract = {As wheat demand is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), domestic production is being encouraged. The potential to increase the productivity and profitability of wheat appears large in the region, but little is known about the concrete interventions needed to meet that potential. In this study, we selected a site in Northern Rwanda (representative of the cool humid climatic zone which accounts for most of the spring wheat production of SSA) and analysed the determinants of wheat productivity and profitability for 130 smallholder farms during two consecutive short rainy seasons, namely 2017A and 2018A (wheat is seldom grown during long rainy seasons: potato is the preferred crop then). Although wheat yields were found to be high when compared to typical yields in SSA (means of 3469 and 3052 kg ha −1 during the seasons 2017A and 2018A, respectively), large yield gaps were also found (1.977 t ha −1 on average, or 37.6{\%} of the highest farmer's yield, defined as the average actual yields above the 90th percentile of this variable). Evidences presented in the paper suggest that wheat productivity could be increased through increased seeding rate (a 0.14{\%} increase in wheat grain yield was found with a 1{\%} increase in seeding rate), increased nitrogen (N) application combined with frequent weeding (a 0.02{\%} increase in wheat grain yield was found with a 1{\%} increase in N application and frequent weeding), and labour-saving technologies (e.g., herbicides and mechanization). If wheat profitability would also increase with frequent weeding and labour-saving technologies, it would decrease with increased input use in many cases. Indeed, seed, fertilizer and amendments represent most of the wheat production cost in the area. These results illustrate the importance of assessing the impact of narrowing the yield gap on profitability, not only productivity, as some yield-increasing technologies may not be desirable from an economic perspective. They also demonstrate that resource-saving technologies (input-saving e.g., precision agriculture, labour-saving e.g., mechanization) may be as much in demand by African smallholders as yield-increasing technologies, calling for a more balanced approach in current research and development initiatives on the continent.},

@article{Lu2014,
abstract = {To investigate the dynamics of social networks and the formation and evolution of online communities in response to extreme events, we collected three datasets from Twitter shortly before and after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We find that while almost all users increased their online activity after the earthquake, Japanese speakers, who are assumed to be more directly affected by the event, expanded the network of people they interact with to a much higher degree than English speakers or the global average. By investigating the evolution of communities, we find that the behavior of joining or quitting a community is far from random: users tend to stay in their current status and are less likely to join new communities from solitary or shift to other communities from their current community. While non-Japanese speakers did not change their conversation topics significantly after the earthquake, nearly all Japanese users changed their conversations to earthquake-related content. This study builds a systematic framework for investigating human behaviors under extreme events with online social network data and our findings on the dynamics of networks and communities may provide useful insight for understanding how patterns of social interaction are influenced by extreme events.},

abstract = {Categorical data dimensions appear in many real-world data sets, but few visualization methods exist that properly deal with them. Parallel Sets are a new method for the visualization and interactive exploration of categorical data that shows data frequencies instead of the individual data points. The method is based on the axis layout of parallel coordinates, with boxes representing the categories and parallelograms between the axes showing the relations between categories. In addition to the visual representation, we designed a rich set of interactions. Parallel Sets allow the user to interactively remap the data to new categorizations and, thus, to consider more data dimensions during exploration and analysis than usually possible. At the same time, a metalevel, semantic representation of the data is built. Common procedures, like building the cross product of two or more dimensions, can be performed automatically, thus complementing the interactive visualization. We demonstrate Parallel Sets by analyzing a large CRM data set, as well as investigating housing data from two US states. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},
