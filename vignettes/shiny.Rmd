## Problem

In an interactive visualization, it is visually cleaner and better for interpretation if labels and other information appear as "tooltips" when the user hovers over or clicks on elements of the plot, rather than displaying all the labels on the plot at one time. However, the **ggalluvial** package does not natively include this functionality. It is possible to enable this using functions from several other packages. This vignette illustrates how to create Shiny apps that display an alluvial plot with tooltips that appear when the user hovers over two different plot elements: strata created with `geom_stratum()` and alluvia created with `geom_alluvium()`. An example is provided for wide-format alluvial data (the UCBAdmissions dataset) and long-format alluvial data (the vaccinations dataset).

The tooltips that appear when the user hovers over elements of the plot show a text label and the count in each group. If the user hovers or clicks somewhere inside a ggplot panel, Shiny automatically returns information about the location of the mouse cursor *in plot coordinates*. That means the main work we have to do is to extract or manually recalculate the coordinates of the different plot elements. With that information, we can determine which plot element the cursor is hovering over and display the appropriate information in the tooltip or other output method.

_Note:_ The app demonstrated here depends on the packages **htmltools** and **sp**, in addition of course to **ggalluvial** and **shiny**. Please be aware that all of these packages will need to be installed on the server where your Shiny app is running.

### Hovering over and clicking on strata

Enabling hovering over and clicking on strata is straightforward because of their rectangular shape. We only need the minimum and maximum `x` and `y` coordinates for each of the rectangles. The rectangles are evenly spaced along the x-axis, centered on positive integers beginning with 1. The width is set in `geom_stratum()` so, for example, we know that the x-coordinates of the first stratum are 1 &plusmn; `width`/2. The y-coordinates can be determined from the number of rows in the input data multiplied by their weights.

### Hovering over and clicking on alluvia

Hovering over and clicking on alluvia are more difficult because the shapes of the alluvia are more complex. The default shape of the polygons includes an `xspline` curve drawn using the **grid** package. We need to manually reconstruct the coordinates of the polygons, then use `sp::pointInPolygon()` to detect which, if any, polygons the cursor is over.

## App with wide-format alluvial data

The UC-Berkeley admissions dataset is used for the first example app.

```{r toy dataset, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
data(UCBAdmissions)
UCBAdmissions <- as.data.frame(UCBAdmissions)
# Arrange data so that the row IDs match the order in the data
UCBAdmissions <- UCBAdmissions[order(UCBAdmissions$Admit, UCBAdmissions$Gender, UCBAdmissions$Dept), ]
```

Here is a static plot generated using the Berkeley admissions dataset.

```{r static plot, fig.width = 6}
ggplot(UCBAdmissions,
            aes(y = Freq, axis1 = Gender, axis2 = Dept)) + 
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Admit), knot.pos = 1/4) + 
  geom_stratum(width = 1/4, reverse = TRUE, fill = 'black', color = 'grey') + 
  geom_label(aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), 
             stat = "stratum", 
             reverse = TRUE, 
             size = rel(3)) + 
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set1") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Gender", "Dept"), expand = c(.05, .05)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  ggtitle("UC Berkeley admissions and rejections, by sex and department")
```

## Structure of the example app

Here, we will go over each section of the code in detail. The full source code is included in the package's `examples` directory.

The app first loads the data and builds the plot. Then, information is extracted from the built plot object to manually recalculate the coordinates of the polygons that make up the plot. Internally, **ggalluvial** uses the **grid** package to draw the polygons, so the next step is to convert the coordinates from **grid** units to the units that appear on the plot's coordinate system. Next, the user interface is defined. Finally, in the server function, the tooltip is defined. This includes logic to determine whether the mouse is hovering over a stratum, an alluvium, or neither, based on the mouse coordinates provided by Shiny. If the mouse is hovering over a plot element, the app finds appropriate information and prints it in a small "tooltip" box next to the mouse cursor.

This is the structure of the app in pseudocode.

```{r pseudocode, eval = FALSE}

'<Load data.>'

'<Create "ggplot" object for alluvial plot and build it.>'

'<Extract data from built plot object used to create alluvium polygons.>'

for (polygon in polygons) {
     '<Use polygon splines to generate coordinates of alluvium boundaries.>'
}

'<Define range of coordinates in grid units and plot units.>'

for (polygon in polygons) {    
     '<Convert coordinates from grid units to plot units.>'
}

ui <- fluidPage(
     '<Output plot with hovering enabled.>'
     
     '<Output tooltip.>'
)


server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
  output$alluvial_plot <- renderPlot({
    '<Render the plot.>'
  })
  
  output$tooltip <- renderText({
    if ('<mouse cursor is within the plot panel>') {
      if ('<mouse cursor is within a stratum box>') {
        '<Render stratum tooltip.>'
      } else {
        if ('<mouse cursor is within an alluvium polygon>') {
          '<Render alluvium tooltip.>'
        }
      }
    }
  })
  
}
```

### Drawing the plot and extracting coordinates

First, we create the `ggplot` object for the alluvial plot, then we call the `ggplot_build()` function to build the plot without displaying it. 

(INSERT CODE HERE)

Now for the hard part: reverse-engineering the coordinates of the alluvia polygons. This makes use of `pbuilt$data[[1]]`, a data frame with the individual elements of the alluvial plot. We add an additional column for `width`, which has a value of 1/3 hard-coded into `ggalluvial::geom_alluvium()`, then split the data frame by group (groups correspond to the individual alluvium polygons). We apply the unexported function `ggalluvial:::data_to_xspline()` to each element of the list to get the x-spline coordinates. Then, we pass the x-spline coordinates to the function `grid::xsplineGrob()` to convert them into a `grid` object. We pass the resulting object to `grid::xsplinePoints()`. At this point we now have the coordinates of the alluvium polygons.

(INSERT CODE HERE)

The coordinates we have are in grid plotting units but we need to convert them into the same units as the axes on the plot. We do this by determining the range of the x and y axes in grid units (`xrange_old` and `yrange_old`), then fixing the range of the x axis as 1 to the number of strata, adjusted by the width of the nodes, and the y axis to the number of rows in the data (again, this is possible here because each flow polygon is exactly 1 unit high).

(INSERT CODE HERE)

We define a function `new_range_transform()` inline and apply it to each set of coordinates. Now we have the coordinates of the polygons in plot units! 

(INSERT CODE HERE)

### User interface

The app includes a minimal user interface with two output elements.

```{r ui, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(tags$div(
    style = "position: relative;",
    plotOutput("alluvial_plot", height = "500px", 
               hover = hoverOpts(id = "plot_hover")
               ),
    htmlOutput("tooltip")))
)
```

The elements are:

- a `plotOutput` with the argument `hover` defined, to enable behavior determined by the cursor's plot coordinates whenever the user hovers over the plot.
- an `htmlOutput` for the tooltip that appears next to the cursor on hover.

Both of the elements are wrapped in a `fluidRow()` and a `div()` tag.

_Note:_ This vignette only illustrates how to display output when the user hovers over an element. If you want to display output when the user clicks on an element, the corresponding argument to `plotOutput()` is `click = clickOpts(id = "plot_click")`. This will return the location of the mouse cursor in plot coordinates when the user clicks somewhere within the plot panel.

_Also Note:_ In the example presented here, all of the plot drawing and coordinate extracting code is outside the `server()` function, because the plot itself does not change with user input. However if you are building an app where the plot changes in response to user input, for example a menu of options of which variables to display, the plot drawing code has to be inside the `renderPlot()` expression. This means that the coordinates may need to be recalculated each time the user input changes as well. In that case, you may need to use the global assignment operator `<<-` so that the coordinates are accessible outside the `renderPlot()` expression.

### Server function

In the server function, we first call `renderPlot()` and pass the ggplot object to `output`.

Next, we define the tooltip with a `renderText()` expression. Within that expression, we first extract the cursor's plot coordinates from the user input. We determine whether the cursor is hovering over a stratum and if so, display the appropriate tooltip.

![screenshot of tooltip on stratum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corybrunson/ggalluvial/main/vignettes/img/hover_stratum.jpg)

If the mouse cursor is not hovering over a stratum, we determine whether it is hovering over an alluvium polygon and if so, display different information in the tooltip.

![screenshot of tooltip on alluvium](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corybrunson/ggalluvial/main/vignettes/img/hover_alluvium.jpg)

If the mouse cursor is hovering over an empty region of the plot, nothing is returned by `renderText()` and so no tooltip text box is displayed.

![screenshot of cursor over empty region](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corybrunson/ggalluvial/main/vignettes/img/hover_empty_area.jpg)

Let's take a deeper dive into the logic used to determine the text that appears in the tooltip.

First, we check whether the cursor is inside the plot panel. If it is not, the element `plot_hover` of the input will be `NULL`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output$tooltip <- renderText(
  if(!is.null(input$plot_hover)) { ... }
  ...
)
```

#### Hovering over a stratum

Next, we check whether the cursor is over a stratum. We round the x-coordinate of the mouse cursor in data units to the nearest integer, then determine whether the x-coordinate is within `node_width/2` of that integer. If so, the mouse cursor is horizontally within the box.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
hover <- input$plot_hover
x_coord <- round(hover$x)
    
if(abs(hover$x - x_coord) < (node_width / 2)) { ... }
```

The nearest integer to the y-coordinate corresponds to the row of the data frame because we set `reverse = TRUE` and all `weight = 1` in the input data. So, for example, the first row of the data frame corresponds to y range `c(0, 1)`, the second `c(1, 2)`, and so forth. This gives us all the information we need to find the index of the rows of the input data that goes with the stratum the cursor is on. _Note:_ It is necessary for the input data to be sorted in ascending order of the `group` column, named `cluster` in this example. If it is not sorted in this way, the relative order of the flows along the y-axis will not correspond to their order in the data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
node_row <- 
  pbuilt$data[[2]]$x == x_coord & hover$y > pbuilt$data[[2]]$ymin & hover$y < pbuilt$data[[2]]$ymax
```

We get the name of the stratum as well as the total number of flows passing through it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
node_label <- pbuilt$data[[2]]$stratum[node_row]
node_n <- pbuilt$data[[2]]$n[node_row]
```

Finally, we render a tooltip using the `div` tag and passing it to `htmltools::renderTags()`. Note that the tooltip positioning is provided in CSS coordinates (pixels), not data coordinates. This does not require any additional effort on our part because `plot_hover` also includes the mouse cursor location in those units.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
renderTags(
  tags$div(
    node_label, tags$br(),
    "n =", node_n,
    style = paste0(
      "position: absolute; ",
      "top: ", hover$coords_css$y + offset, "px; ",
      "left: ", hover$coords_css$x + offset, "px; ",
      "background: gray; ",
      "padding: 3px; ",
      "color: white; "
    )
  )
)$html
```

#### Hovering over an alluvium

If the cursor is not over a stratum, the next logic checks whether it is over an alluvium. This is done using the function `sp::point.in.polygon` applied across each of the polygons for which we defined the coordinates inside the `renderPlot` expression.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
hover_within_flow <- sapply(
  polygon_coords,
  function(pol) point.in.polygon(point.x = hover$x, 
                                 point.y = hover$y, 
                                 pol.x = pol$x, 
                                 pol.y = pol$y)
)
```

If at least one polygon is beneath the mouse cursor, we locate the corresponding row in the input data and extract information to display in the tooltip. In the situation where there are more than one polygon overlapping, we get the information for the polygon that is plotted last by calling `rev()` on the logical vector returned by `point.in.polygon()`. This means that the tooltip will display information from the alluvium that appears "on top" in the plot. In this example, we will display the names of all the nodes that the alluvium passes through.

```{r info for alluvia tooltip, eval = FALSE}
coord_id <- rev(which(hover_within_flow == 1))[1]
flow_id <- example_data$ID[coord_id]
axis_values <- example_data[flow_id, c('grp1', 'grp2', 'grp3')]
```

We render a tooltip that shows the names of all the nodes that the hovered path passes through, using very similar syntax to the above tooltip.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
renderTags(
  tags$div(
    paste(axis_values, collapse = ' -> '),
    style = paste0(
      "position: absolute; ",
      "top: ", hover$coords_css$y + offset, "px; ",
      "left: ", hover$coords_css$x + offset, "px; ",
      "background: gray; ",
      "padding: 3px; ",
      "color: white; "
    )
  )
)$html
```

## App with long-format alluvial data

The vaccinations dataset is used for long-format alluvial data. This vignette does not go through the code as thoroughly. The main thing to note is that the way the app calculates the range transformations and populates the data to display in the tooltip is slightly different, given the different input data. However, the changes are minimal because the output of `ggplot_build()` that is used to find the polygon coordinates and information is essentially the same regardless of the initial format of the input data.

Notable differences between the two apps are as follows:

## Conclusion

This vignette demonstrates how to enable tooltips for **ggalluvial** plots in Shiny apps. However it's important to note that some of the workarounds are slightly inelegant. This may not be the optimal way to do it &mdash; other solutions are certainly possible!

## Embedded Shiny apps

The full source code for both of these Shiny apps is included with the **ggalluvial** package in the **examples** subdirectory where the package is installed: the source files are `ggalluvial/examples/ex-shiny-long-data/app.R` and `ggalluvial/examples/ex-shiny-wide-data/app.R` respectively.

### Wide format: UCBAdmissions

```{r wide app, echo = FALSE}
shinyAppDir(
  system.file("examples/ex-shiny-wide-data", package="ggalluvial"),
  options = list(width = "100%", height = 600)
)
```

### Long format: vaccinations
